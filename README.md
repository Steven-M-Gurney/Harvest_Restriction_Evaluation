## Abstract

Evaluating changes in population abundance is essential to assess the efficacy of conservation actions. Antler point restrictions are a high-profile regulatory action aimed to advance male age structure in cervid populations, but there is a limited understanding on how restrictions affect population size and structure. Our study evaluated population-level effects of an antler point restriction on white-tailed deer (*Odocoileus virginianus*) abundance and sex-and-age composition using a before-after control-impact design. Antler point restrictions are intended to increase the abundance of legal-antlered deer, but the impact on the abundance of antlerless deer is less known. We conducted camera-trap surveys of deer in zones with and without antler point restrictions before and three years after the implementation of restrictions and used N-mixture models to estimate annual abundance by sex-and-age class. Our results suggest that the restrictions did not influence population abundance of deer. Abundance of legal-antlered deer increased in both the restriction zone and non-restriction zone (opposing prediction); and female, sublegal antlered, and fawn abundance increased in both the restriction zone and non-restriction zone (opposing prediction). Partial controllability, or a failure of the regulation to influence realized harvest, likely explains these results, since antlerless deer harvest did not change throughout the duration of our study while slight but insignificant change in antlered harvest was observed in the restriction zone. Our results highlight potential limitations of antler point restrictions achieving desired effects for population reduction goals and the importance of independently evaluating conservation and management actions.
